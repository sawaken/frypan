# Frypan

Very small and simple library to do FRP (Functional Reactive Programming) in Ruby in a similar way to Elm.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'frypan'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install frypan

## Short Tutorial

To experience FRP and understand how to use this library, we make an imitation of Linux's atd(8) and at(1).
